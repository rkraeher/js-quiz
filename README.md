# js-quiz
A timed quiz testing a new student's knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals

// # Acceptance Criteria
// GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
// WHEN I click the start button
// THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
// WHEN I answer a question
// THEN I am presented with another question
// WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
// THEN time is subtracted from the clock
// WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
// THEN the game is over
// WHEN the game is over
// THEN I can save my initials and score

// #Pseudo Code
// I want a welcome page that describes the quiz
// The welcome page has a start quiz button that begins the quiz
// Pressing the start button also begins a timer that counts down
// There are multiple choice and true/false questions with multiple buttons for the user to press to answer
// There is a score counter that keeps track of every correct answer
// If a user answers a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the timer as a penalty
// Either when the user answers all questions OR the timer reaches 0, the game ends
// At the end of the game, a page is displayed with the final score and an input for user initials
// The user intials and score are saved in local storage and displayed as the last saved input (View High Scores)
// There is a button to restart the quiz.
