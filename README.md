# js-quiz

#Description
A timed quiz testing a new student's knowledge of the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The quiz questions and possible responses are dynamically generated 
using JavaScript. 

A user is given instructions on the rules of the quiz, which include: 60 seconds for completion and 10 seconds removed from the timer
for every incorrect response. 

When the timer reaches 0 or the user has responded to all questions, the game ends and displays the user's score along with an input to save their score
to a username that they type.

Scores are saved in local storage, but can be cleared if the user clicks the clear scores button. There is also a button to restart the quiz. 

The text size has a responsive design and will shrink on smaller screens via media queries.
